# Review evidence — 2026-10-18

## Delivered foundation
- Empty target inspected through GitHub and git.
- Qucs-S pinned at 46e47e8fabe852a9d6aab41d8a612ff5a78370c1 (upstream VERSION 26.1.1).
- Mature editor retained as submodule; no custom editor or virtual instruments claimed.
- Python build orchestration, RC netlist, analytical validator, failure tests, two CI jobs added.

## Local verification
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: six tests PASS. These test the validator using synthetic analytic data, not the real solver.
- `python3 scripts/verify_rc.py --output reports/rc.json`: FAIL as intended when ngspice is absent. No real numerical result recorded yet.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- System package installation blocked by environment setgroups/setuid restrictions; Qt/CMake/ngspice build could not run locally.

## Self-critique
The repository now has an engineering foundation, not a completed Multisim alternative. The Linux CI build is not interactive GUI verification. A passing RC analytic test is not an NI comparison. Windows packaging, custom instruments and ms14 import remain unimplemented. A genuine Multisim file is still needed for interoperability work; a fixture must not be invented.

## Next bounded task
Read CI logs and fix build/simulation failures. Obtain a native Windows build and test placing/wiring/saving/reopening/running an RC schematic. Record screenshots plus actual solver output. Preserve original upstream branding until a reviewed original design is ready.

## Supervision
A bounded hourly follow-up was created for 24 runs starting 2026-10-18 03:15 Asia/Baghdad. Existing general summaries remain separate. Scheduling does not prove a running Codex Cloud session or guarantee tools/quota on future runs.
